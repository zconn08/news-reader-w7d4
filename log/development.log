There’s sure to be a lot of red meat for Republicans and eye rolling from Democrats, but there’s also a wildcard in this year’s debate: Donald Trump.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Trump announced his candidacy in June, his poll numbers have done nothing but increase. What’s Trump done?  Call Mexican illegal immigrants criminals. Polls go up. Give out Sen. Lindsay Graham’s cell phone. Polls go up. Suggest John McCain isn’t a war hero because he was a POW. Still leads the polls. So just how does one debate Donald Trump and win?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe first thing we must understand is that a presidential debate is not like an academic debate. In an academic debate or in a courtroom, people who are trained to evaluate evidence and arguments get to make the decisions on who wins/loses. In a presidential debate, the American people get to evaluate the arguments. \\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EDonald Trump brings an elitist bravado back to the Republican Party. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EThe American electorate is not trained to assess the arguments and they may not be informed enough on specific issues to follow those arguments based on the relatively short answer time allowed by the formats.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the end of the debate, the news media will report clips that grab the headlines. What will likely make the news is a smart or a sassy one-liner, like when Ronald Reagan put to rest concerns about his mental capacity in his second debate with Walter Mondale, by answering the question about whether a candidate\\u0026#8217;s age should matter by saying, \\u0026#8220;I will not, for political purposes, exploit my opponent\\u0026#8217;s youth and inexperience.\\u0026#8221; Everyone laughed, and suddenly Reagan\\u0026#8217;s incompetence in the first debate no longer mattered.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe second factor that matter is the fact that people tend to vote for the candidates they like the most. This has come to be called the “beer test.” And for some Republicans, Donald Trump brings an elitist bravado back to the Republican Party. Do most people think they’d like to have a beer with Donald Trump? Honestly, probably not. But in a race with 15 other candidates, Donald Trump is a well-known personality—a celebrity—that has defined, an refined his career by delivering one-liners.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003E Trump’s rhetoric will beg for a gut reaction that only serves to help seal a candidate’s fate. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EDebating Donald has both pros and cons. Being on stage means getting more press. Fox News has put Donald Trump front and center on the stage flanked by Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, the two other candidates with double-digit approval ratings. Debates offer candidates the opportunity to gain free publicity for their ideas and intellect.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe negative of appearing with Trump, however, is that one has no idea what he might say or do. It is imperative that candidates not respond to him in a way that makes them look unlikable or incompetent. Trump’s rhetoric will beg for a gut reaction that only serves to help seal a candidate’s fate.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf any one of the candidates were my clients, I would tell them to be more concerned with his own image. It is important to come across well informed and likable. The danger for Trump is that someone could easily get him to lose his cool and do something else that voters might perceive as un-presidential.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe take home that many candidates must remember is that Trump, even though he is leading in the polls, is not seen by virtually any political experts as being a viable candidate. Trump, however, can do significant damage to candidate’s outlook. While it’s highly unlikely he will be the candidate, he will ultimately help Republicans select one.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://ideas@qz.com\\\"\\u003E ideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=474040\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/474040/a-gop-candidates-guide-to-debating-donald-trump-dont-debate-him/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-08-06T11:05:01-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/474040\",\"dc_creator\":\"Nichelle McNabb\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rtx1mk3v.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RICOH Women\\u0026#039;s British Open 2015\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rtx1mk3v.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/474040/a-gop-candidates-guide-to-debating-donald-trump-dont-debate-him/"], ["published_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 18:05:01 UTC +00:00], ["title", "A GOP candidate&#8217;s guide to debating Donald Trump: don&#8217;t debate him"], ["updated_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 18:49:51 UTC +00:00]]

But these arguments are short-sighted; the value of the tax deferral is not just getting people to save more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFirst of all, most estimates overstate the cost to tax-payers. 401(k)s are tax \\u003Cem\\u003Edeferred\\u003C/em\\u003E not tax free. The $399 billion dollar amount is an estimate of how much taxes working people avoid by contributing minus how much retirees pay when they withdraw each year. The government is losing so much money because 401(k)s are still relatively new and people are only now starting to retire and withdraw from them.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s also worth noting that the tax deferred status of these retirement accounts come with risks for savers. In particular, savers are making a bet on what future tax rates will be when they make withdrawals.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESecond, the taxes retirees pay on withdrawals are a powerful tool for policy makers to alter spending in retirement. Without facing a tax on withdrawals, someone might spend everything quickly and rely on government benefits.

Currently, Americans pay a tax penalty if they don\\u0026#8217;t take out a \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-1624444/Final_RMD_Guide.pdf\\\"\\u003Ecertain amount\\u003C/a\\u003E from their retirement accounts each year after turning 70.5.
